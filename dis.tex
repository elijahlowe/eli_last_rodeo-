\begin{abstract}
Tunicates are invertebrate chordates and are the sister group to the vertebrates. Although tunicates have little morphological resemblance to vertebrates in their adult stage, they do share several features in their larval stage: a hollow dorsal neural tube, gill slits, and a post-anal tail, containing a notochord\textemdash a group of cells organized in a rod shaped structure - the key features that classify the phyla. Within the tunicates, several ascidians have undergone tail-loss, and many of them are Molgulidae. Hybrids have been produced through the cross fertilization of two \textit{Molgula} species (\textit{Molgula occulta} and \textit{Molgula oculata}), and no other solitary \textit{Molgula} species have been known to hybridize. Here we have sequenced the transcriptomes of several developmental stages of both \textit{M. occulta} and \textit{M. oculata}\textemdash two closely related, free-spawning ascidian species, and their hybrid, in order to study the mechanisms behind tail loss in \textit{M. occulta}. We were first presented with the problem of identifying the best approach for the \textit{de novo} assembly of our transcriptomes. Here we determined that processing reads through digital normalization, a redundancy reduction step, had less of an effect on assemblies than did the assembler used. We then sequenced and assembled the genomes of  \textit{M. occulta}, \textit{M. oculata} and a more distant species, \textit{M. occidentalis}. This allowed us to characterize the genomes, discovering that the species are more divergent then they appear phenotypically, and also supporting better gene models. Through differential expression analysis we determined that \textit{M. oculata} and the hybrid appear to express many shared transcripts that are up-regulated during the formation of the ascidian tail, and that these genes are primarily upregulated in the tailed species and hybrid in relation to the tail-less species. Furthermore, of those transcripts upregulated at the tailbud stage in the hybrid but not in \textit{M. occulta}, it appears that expression is being restored by the \textit{M. oculata} allele. This suggests that the relative lack of differential gene expression in the neurula-to-tailbud transition in \textit{M. occulta} is due to loss-of-function of cis-regulatory elements controlling the expression of key genes involved in tail and CNS formation.
